		"description": "[WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api), hosted by Meta, is the official WhatsApp Business Platform API used for business messaging. This collection contains common queries, sample responses, and links to supporting documentation that can help you quickly get started with the API.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use the API and this collection you must have a Meta business portfolio, a WhatsApp Business Account, and a business phone number. If you complete the steps in the Cloud API [Get Started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started) guide, these assets will be created for you.\n\n## Environment\n\nThis collection has a corresponding WhatsApp Cloud API Postman [environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) which you must select when using the collection. Set **current values** for the variables defined in this environment if you wish to use the collection to perform queries.\n\nYou can find most of these values in the [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/) or the **WhatsApp** > **Getting Started** panel in the [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps). However, if you have an access token and your business portfolio ID, you can use queries in the collection to get the remaining values.\n\n## Access tokens\n\nThe API supports both user and system user access tokens. You can get a user access token by loading your app in the [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and navigating to the WhatsApp > Getting Started panel. Alternatively you can use the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) to generate one.\n\nSince user access tokens expire after 24 hours, you'll likely want to generate a system user access token, which lasts up to 60 days (or permanently, if you wish). See [Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started#access-tokens) to learn how to create a system user and system user access token.\n\nOnce you have your token, save it as a **current value** in the environment.\n\n## Business portfolio ID\n\nYou can get your business portfolio ID by signing into the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com). The ID appears in the URL as the `business_id` query string parameter value. Once you save this as a **current value** in the environment, go to the WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) folder and run the **Get all owned WABAs** query. This will return your WABA ID, which you can save to your environment and then use to determine your business phone number ID.\n\n## Permissions\n\nThe API only relies on two permissions:\n\n- whatsapp_business_management\n- whatsapp_business_messaging\n    \n\nNote that if you get a user access token from the app dashboard, your app will automatically be granted these permissions (by you, on your behalf), so you can use the token to test right away.\n\nQueries that target your business portfolio require the business_management permission, which you may also need based on your business use case. Most developers do not need this permission, however, as accessing your business portfolio is uncommon, and the Meta Business Suite provides nearly all of this functionality anyway.\n\n## Access token debugger\n\nYou can paste any token you generate into the [access token debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/) to see what type of token it is and what permission you have granted to your app.\n\n## Pagination\n\nEndpoints that return lists/collections may [paginate results](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results) (you'll see previous and next properties in the response). Use the URLs from these properties to get the previous or next set of results. Note that if you click one of these links in Postman, it will open a new query in a new tab which you must save before running (otherwise it can't read your environment variables), so you may wish to cut and paste the URL and run the query in the same tab in which it was returned.",

As per the Signal protocol, the user and the Cloud API, on behalf of the business, negotiate encryption keys and establish a secure communication channel. WhatsApp cannot access any message content exchanged between users and businesses.\n\nOnce a message is received by the Cloud API, it gets decrypted and forwarded to the Business. Messages are only temporarily stored by the Cloud API as required to provide the base API functionality.\n\nMessages from a business to a user flow on the reverse path. Businesses send messages to Cloud API. The Cloud API service stores the messages temporarily and takes on the task to send the message to the WhatsApp platform. Messages are stored for any necessary retransmissions.\n\nAll messages are encrypted by the Cloud API before being sent to WhatsApp using the Signal protocol with keys negotiated with the user (recipient).\n\nWhatsApp acts as the transport service. It provides the message forwarding software; both client and server. It has no visibility into the messages being sent. It protects the users data by detecting unusual messaging patterns (like a business trying to message all users) or collecting spam reports from users.\n\nCloud API, operated by Meta, acts as the intermediary between WhatsApp and the Cloud API businesses. In other words, those businesses have given Cloud API the power to operate on their behalf. Because of this, WhatsApp forwards all message traffic destined for those businesses to Cloud API. WhatsApp also expects to receive from Cloud API all message traffic from those businesses. This is the same client behavior that the On-Premise client has.\n\nWhatsApp gives Cloud API metering and billing information for the Cloud API businesses. It does not share any other messaging information.\n\nMeta, in providing the WhatsApp Cloud API service, acts as a Data Processor on behalf of the business. In other words, the businesses have requested Meta to provide programmatic access to the WhatsApp platform.\n\nCloud API receives from WhatsApp the messages destined for the businesses that use Cloud API. Cloud API also sends to WhatsApp the messages sent by those businesses.  \nOther parts of Meta (other than Cloud API) do not have access to the Cloud API business communications, including message content and metadata. Meta does not use any Cloud API data for advertising."

Cloud API relies on Business Manager and other Meta systems to identify any access to Cloud API on behalf of the business.\n\nMessages sent or received through Cloud API are only accessed by Cloud API, no other part of Meta can use this information. Messages have a maximum retention period of 30 days in order to provide the base features and functionality of the Cloud API service; for example, retransmissions. After 30 days, these features and functionality are no longer available.\n\nCloud API does not rely on any information about the user (customer/consumer) the business is communicating with other than the phone number used to identify the account. This information is used to deliver the messages through the WhatsApp client code. User phone numbers are used as sources or destinations for individual messages; as such they are deleted when messages are deleted. No other part of Meta has access to this information.\n\nLike the On-Premise client, the WhatsApp client code used by Cloud API collects messaging information about the business as required by WhatsApp. This is information used by WhatsApp to detect malicious activity.

See [How to Connect Your Phone Number to Your WhatsApp Business Account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/456220311516626?id=2129163877102343).\n\n### Opt-In\n\nYou are required to obtain user opt-in before sending proactive business-initiated messages. See [Get Opt-In for WhatsApp](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in) for more information.\n\n### Pricing & Payment Methods\n\nBusinesses are charged per conversation, which includes all messages delivered in a 24 hour session. The first 1,000 conversations each month are free. If you want to send more than 1,000 conversations, you need to add a credit card to your account.\n\nFor more information see [Pricing and Payment Methods](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/getting-started/signing-up#pricing---payment-methods).\n\n### Send More Messages\n\nTo send more business-initiated messages, you need to use message templates. WhatsApp message templates are specific message formats that businesses use to send out notifications or customer care messages to people that have opted in to notifications.\n\nBefore sending a message template, you [need to create one](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364) or you can [use one of our pre-approved templates](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/722393685250070). Check [this guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates) to learn how to send message templates.\n\nIncoming messages are unlimited, but there are limits for outgoing messages. See [Messaging Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/rate-limits/#messaging) for more information on messaging tiers."

					"description": "### Read Documentation\n\nBefore you start, we recommend reading through our [developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api) and our [Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13382743/UVC5FTHT?fbclid=IwAR1ZHbYefEkctmotxeooOM9ZV9U5yiWsD4fh64RC-QihuKgDDurd15J6ZR0). This helps you understand how the Cloud API works, including how to get started and migrate numbers.\n\n### Plan Onboarding & Migration\n\n**You must use Embedded Signup to onboard new customers to the Cloud API.** If you haven’t already, integrate and launch [Embedded Signup](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/embedded-signup). Embedded Signup is the fastest and easiest way to register customers, enabling them to start sending messages in less than five minutes.\n\nNext, **think about which clients you want to migrate to the Cloud API first**. Our general recommendation is to migrate all of your clients from the On-Premises to the Cloud API, but each client’s need may vary. As you think about which clients to migrate, consider:\n\n| Consideration | More Context |\n| --- | --- |\n|   <br>Are my client’s throughputs and message volumes supported by Cloud API?  <br>  <br> |   <br>The Cloud API supports most businesses at 80 messages/second cumulative peak throughput, including text/media and ingoing/outgoing.  <br>  <br> |\n|   <br>Are my client’s compliance needs met by the Cloud API?  <br> |   <br>The Cloud API is GDPR compliant and has SOC 2 certification. Servers are hosted in North America.  <br>  <br> |\n|   <br>Are my clients using features supported by the Cloud API?  <br>  <br> |   <br>Most major features are supported. See full list [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview/on-premises-cloud-api-comparison#messaging-features). |\n\nOnce you know who’s going to be migrated, you can build a migration plan and timeline.\n\nAs you create your plan, remember to design your system for two scenarios: onboarding new customers and migrating current customers from On-Premises to Cloud API. For the migration scenario, include plans to backup your current On-Premises instance and migrate those numbers to the Cloud API.\n\n### Plan Communication With Clients\n\nFirst, you need to decide whether to notify existing clients about migration. Then, you should determine if you need to create or update any documentation to support the Cloud API setup.\n\n### Make Pricing Decisions\n\nSince the hosting costs for the Cloud API are covered by Meta, you should decide if you would like to update your prices accordingly."

Remember to add a display name and a contact email to your app.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>As a BSP (Business Solution Provider), your app must go through [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review) and request Advanced Access to the following permissions:  <br>  <br>* [`whatsapp_business_management`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/whatsapp_business_management) — Used to manage phone numbers, message templates, registration, business profile under a WhatsApp Business Account. To get this permission, your app must go through [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review).  <br>* `whatsapp_business_messaging` — Used to send/receive messages from WhatsApp users, upload/download media under a WhatsApp Business Account. To get this permission, your app must go through [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review).  <br>* `business_management`  <br>  <br>[See a sample App Review submission here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review/resources/sample-submissions/whatsapp-business-api).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>As a BSP, you can also feel free to use the same Meta app across different clients and WABAs. But be aware that each app can only have one webhook endpoint and each app needs to go through App Review.  <br>  <br> |\n|   <br>  <br>**System User**  <br>  <br> |   <br>  <br>See [Add System Users to Your Business Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/503306463479099) for help.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Currently, a Meta App with `whatsapp_business_messaging`, `whatsapp_business_management`, and `business_messaging` permissions has access to up to:  <br>  <br>* 1 admin system user, and  <br>* 1 employee system user  <br>  <br>We recommend using the admin system user for your production deployment. See [About Business Manager Roles and Permissions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606) for more information.  <br>  <br> |\n|   <br>  <br>**Business Phone Number**  <br>  <br> |   <br>  <br>This is the phone number the business will use to send messages. Phone numbers need to be verified through SMS/voice call.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>For BSPs and Direct Businesses: If you wish to use your own number, then you should [add a phone number](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/456220311516626) in WhatsApp Manager and verify it with the verify endpoint via [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/phone-numbers#verify).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>For Businesses using BSPs: If you wish to use your own number, then you should add and verify their numbers using the BSP’s [Embedded Signup flow](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/embedded-signup).  <br>  <br>  <br>The verification status of a phone number doesn't impact the migration between On-Premises and Cloud API. If you don't have access to Embedded Signup to verify phone numbers, we recommend verifying the phone numbers using the On-Premises solution, and then migrating those numbers to the Cloud API.  <br>  <br>There is no limit to the amount of business phone numbers that can be onboarded to the Cloud API.  <br>  <br>  <br>Only one phone number can be used on a platform at a time: One for [Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api) and another for [On-Premises](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/on-premises). This means that you cannot use a production phone number with both the On-Premises and Cloud APIs. We recommend doing any testing with a test number (either an existing test number or a new one) and then moving your own phone number to the Cloud API when you’re confident you’re ready for production use.  <br>  <br> |\n|   <br>  <br>**Consumer Phone Number**  <br>  <br> |   <br>  <br>This is a phone number that is currently using the consumer WhatsApp app. This number will be receiving the messages sent by your business phone number.  <br>  <br> |"

					"description": "### Step 1: Get System User Access Token\n\nGraph API calls use access tokens for authentication. For more information, see [Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/). We recommend using your system user to generate your token.\n\nTo generate a system user access token:\n\n1.  Go to [Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/) > Business Settings > Users > System Users to view the system user you created.\n2.  Click on that user and select Add Assets. This action launches a new window.\n3.  Under Select Asset Type on the left side pane, select Apps. Under Select Assets, choose the Meta app you want to use (your app must have the correct permissions). Enable Develop App for that app.\n4.  Select Save Changes to save your settings and return to the system user main screen.\n5.  Now you are ready to generate your token. In the system user main screen, click Generate Token and select your Meta app. After selecting the app, you see a list of available permissions. Select `whatsapp_business_management`, `whatsapp_business_messaging`, and `business_management`. Click Generate Token.\n6.  A new window opens with your system user, assigned app and access token. Save your token.\n7.  Optionally, you can click on your token and see the Token Debugger. In your debugger, you should see the two permissions you have selected. You can also directly paste your token into the [Access Token Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken).\n    \n\n### Step 2: Set up Webhooks\n\nWith Webhooks set up, you can receive real-time HTTP notifications from the WhatsApp Business Platform. This means you get notified when, for example, you get a message from a customer or there are changes to your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA).\n\nTo set up your Webhook, you need to create an internet-facing web server with a URL that meets Meta’s and WhatsApp’s requirements. See [Creating an Endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started/#create-endpoint) for instructions on how to do that. If you need an endpoint for testing purposes, [you can generate a test Webhooks endpoint](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/webhooks/generate-endpoint).\n\n#### App Setup\n\nOnce the endpoint is ready, configure it to be used by your Meta app:\n\nIn your App Dashboard, find the WhatsApp product and click **Configuration**. Then, find the webhooks section and click **Configure a webhook**. After the click, a dialog appears on your screen and asks you for two items:\n\n*   Callback URL: This is the URL Meta will be sending the events to. See the [Webhooks, Getting Started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started) guide for information on creating the URL.\n*   Verify Token: This string is set up by you, when you create your webhook endpoint.\n    \n\nAfter adding the information, click **Verify and Save**.\n\nBack in the App Dashboard, click **WhatsApp** > **Configuration** in the left-side panel. Under Webhooks, click **Manage**. A dialog box will open with all the objects you can get notified about. To receive messages from your users, click **Subscribe** for **messages**.\n\nYou only need to set up Webhooks once for every application you have. You can use the same Webhook to receive multiple event types from multiple WhatsApp Business Accounts. For more information, see our Webhooks section.\n\nAt any time, each Meta App can have only one endpoint configured. If you need to send your webhook updates to multiple endpoints, you need multiple Meta Apps.\n\n### Step 3: Subscribe to your WABA\n\nTo make sure you get notifications for the correct account, subscribe your app:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'https://graph.facebook.com/{{Version}}/WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID/subscribed_apps' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'\n\n```\n\n[Copy Code](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#)\n\nIf you get the response below, all Webhook events for the phone numbers under this account will be sent to your configured Webhooks endpoint.\n\n```\n{\n  \"success\": \"true\"\n}\n\n```\n\n### Step 4: Get Phone Number ID\n\nTo send messages, you need to register the phone number you want to use —this is the business phone number we mentioned in [Before You Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#before-you-start).\n\nBefore you can proceed to registration, you need to find that phone number’s ID. To get your phone number’s ID, make the following API call:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET \\\n 'https://graph.facebook.com/{{Version}}/WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID/phone_numbers' \\\n -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'\n\n```\n\n[Copy Code](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#)\n\nIf the request is successful, the response includes all phone numbers connected to your WABA:\n\n```\n{\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"verified_name\": \"Jasper's Market\",\n      \"display_phone_number\": \"+1 631-555-5555\",\n      \"id\": \"1906385232743451\",\n      \"quality_rating\": \"GREEN\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"verified_name\": \"Jasper's Ice Cream\",\n      \"display_phone_number\": \"+1 631-555-5556\",\n      \"id\": \"1913623884432103\",\n      \"quality_rating\": \"NA\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\nSave the ID for the phone number you want to register. See [Read Phone Numbers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/phone-numbers) for more information about this endpoint.\n\n#### Migration Exception\n\nIf you are migrating a phone number from the On-Premises API to the Cloud API, there are extra steps you need to perform before registering a phone number with the Cloud API. See [Migrate Between On-Premises and Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/migrate-between-on-premises-and-cloud-api) for the full process.\n\n### Step 5: Register Phone Number\n\nWith the phone number’s ID in hand, you can register it. In the registration API call, you perform two actions at the same time:\n\n1.  Register the phone.\n2.  [Enable two-step verification](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/two-step-verification) by setting a 6-digit registration code —you must set this code on your end. Save and memorize this code as it can be requested later. **Setting up two-factor authentication is a requirement to use the Cloud API.**\n    \n\nSample request:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'https://graph.facebook.com/{{Version}}/FROM_PHONE_NUMBER_ID/register' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \\\n  -d '{\n    \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\",\n    \"pin\": \"6_DIGIT_PIN\"\n  }'\n\n```\n\n[Copy Code](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#)\n\nSample response:\n\n```\n{\n  \"success\": \"true\"\n}\n\n```\n\n#### Embedded Signup Users\n\nA phone number **must** be registered up to 14 days after going through the Embedded Signup flow. If a number is not registered during that window, the phone must go through to the Embedded Signup flow again prior to registration.\n\n### Step 6: Receive a Message From Consumer App\n\nOnce participating customers send a message to your business, you get **24 hours of free messages with them** —that window of time is called the customer service window. For testing purposes, we want to enable this window, so you can send as many messages as you would like.\n\nFrom a personal WhatsApp iOS/Android app, send a message to the phone number you just registered. Once the message is sent, you should receive an incoming message to your Webhook with a notification in the following format.\n\n```\n{\n  \"object\": \"whatsapp_business_account\",\n  \"entry\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID\",\n      \"changes\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\",\n            \"metadata\": {\n              \"display_phone_number\": \"16315551234\",\n              \"phone_number_id\": \"PHONE_NUMBER_ID\"\n            },\n            \"contacts\": [\n              {\n                \"profile\": {\n                  \"name\": \"Kerry Fisher\"\n                },\n                \"wa_id\": \"16315555555\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"messages\": [\n              {\n                \"from\": \"16315555555\",\n                \"id\": \"wamid.ABGGFlA5FpafAgo6tHcNmNjXmuSf\",\n                \"timestamp\": \"1602139392\",\n                \"text\": {\n                  \"body\": \"Hello!\"\n                },\n                \"type\": \"text\"\n                }\n            ]\n          },\n        \"field\": \"messages\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n### Step 7: Send a Test Message\n\nOnce you have enabled the customer service window, you can send a test message to the consumer number you used in the previous step. To do that, make the following API call:\n\n```\ncurl -X  POST \\\n  'https://graph.facebook.com/{{Version}}/FROM_PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN' \\\n  -d '{\n      \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\", \n      \"to\": \"16315555555\",\n      \"text\": {\"body\" : \"hello world!\"}\n  }'\n\n```\n\n[Copy Code](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started#)\n\nIf your call is successful, your response will include a message ID. Use that ID to track the progress of your messages via Webhooks.\n\nSample response:\n\n```\n{\n    \"id\":\"wamid.gBGGFlaCGg0xcvAdgmZ9plHrf2Mh-o\"\n}\n\n```\n\nWith the Cloud API, there is no longer a way to explicitly check if a phone number has a WhatsApp ID. To send someone a message using the Cloud API, just send it directly to the customer's phone number —after they have [opted-in](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/getting-opt-in). See [Reference, Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#examples) for examples."

We recommend marking incoming messages as read within 30 days of receipt.\n\nYou cannot mark outgoing messages you sent as read.\n\n## Step 1: Obtain `message_id` of incoming message\n\nFirst, find the `message_id` for the message you want to mark as `read`. You can find this ID in the webhooks notification you get when you receive a message. See [Webhooks](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks) for information.\n\n## Step 2: Make API call to update message status\n\nCall the `/PHONE_NUMBER_ID/messages` endpoint and include your `message_id`.

							"description": "To migrate from On-Premises to Cloud API, follow these steps:\n\n**Optional Step 0: Verify Phone Numbers**\n\n*(This step is only relevant if you don’t have access to Embedded Signup to verify phone numbers. If that doesn’t apply to you, move to Step 1.)*\n\nThe verification status of a phone number doesn't impact the migration between On-Premises and Cloud API. If you don't have access to Embedded Signup to verify phone numbers, we recommend verifying the phone numbers using the On-Premises solution, and then migrating those numbers to the Cloud API.\n\n**Step 1: Select Best Time for Migration**\n\nWe recommend performing migration during a maintenance window while traffic to the On-Premises deployment is low/turned off. Downtime is typically less than 5 minutes, and no re-verification of the phone number is required.\n\n**Step 2: Backup On-Premises Content**\n\nWe don’t provide full database migration, so you must back up your data before moving a phone number from On-Premises to Cloud API. Before starting the backup, make sure you are in single instance mode and not multi-connect.\n\nOnce you are ready, use the On-Premises [Backup API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/settings/backup-and-restore/):\n\n``` json\nPOST /v1/settings/backup  \n{  \n    \"password\": \"your-password\"  \n}\n\n```\n\nA successful response looks like this:\n\n``` json\n{  \n    \"settings\": \n    {  \n      \"data\": \"encrypted-backup-data\"  \n    }  \n}\n\n```\n\nSave the data for the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Call /register to Start Migration**\n\nTo migrate your account, make a **POST** call to the **`PHONE_NUMBER_ID/register`** endpoint. Inside the backup object, include the backup data obtained during the previous step:\n\n``` bash\n`curl -X POST \\ 'https://graph.facebook.com/{{Version}}/FROM_PHONE_NUMBER_ID/register' \\\n-H 'Authorization: Bearer SYSTEM_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN' \\   \n-d '{   \n    \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\",\n    \"pin\": \"6_DIGIT_PIN\",\n    \"backup\": \n    {   \n        \"password\": \"PASSWORD\",   \n        \"data\": \"BACKUP_DATA\"   \n    }   \n}'\n\n```\n\nA successful response looks like this:\n\n``` json\n{  \n  \"success\": \"true\"  \n}\n\n```\n\nSee all available fields for this endpoint [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/account-migration#parameters).\n\n**Step 4: Prepare to Send Messages**\n\nYou have been migrated to the Cloud API. But, before sending messages, you should perform necessary operations, like [re-uploading media files](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/media) you want to send. Be aware that data (messages, media, etc.) received on the On-Premises API deployment before migration won’t be available in the Cloud API after migration.\n\n**Step 5: Start Sending Messages**\n\nYou are ready to send messages to your customers. See the [/messages endpoint documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages) for guidance."

To make sure you are ready, check [Set Up and Debug Your Network](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/network-requirements).\n\n**Step 2: Register API Client**\n\nTo move from Cloud API to On-Premises you need to register your WhatsApp Business API client. To do that, call the [**`/account`**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/account) endpoint:\n\n``` json\nPOST /v1/account  \n{  \n    \"cc\": \"<your-country-code>\",  \n    \"phone_number\": \"<your-phone-number-without-country-code>\",  \n    \"method\": \"<sms-or-voice>\",  \n    \"cert\": \"<your-verified-name-cert-in-base64>\",  \n    \"pin\": \"<your-existing-6-digit-pin>\"\n}\n\n```\n\nDepending on the response received, the registration procedure can be considered complete or require another step to complete. If successful, you receive one of the following HTTP status codes. Follow the instructions that match the response you received:\n\n*   **201 Created** — The account already exists. You are already registered, so you do not need to do anything else.\n*   **202 Accepted** — The account does not exist. Depending on the method selected in the request, check your SMS or voice number for the registration code. This response will include a returned payload that contains the **`vname`** decoded from the cert parameter for you to confirm the right display name is being set. If correct, proceed to [Completing Your Account Registration](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/account/verify) to complete registration.\n    \n\nSee all available fields for this endpoint [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/account#parameters).\n\n**Step 3: Set Shards**\n\nOnce your client is registered, you can [set shards](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/multiconnect_mc), if needed.\n\n**Step 4: Start Sending Messages**\n\nYou are ready to send messages to your customers.

To do that, you must first [file for a name change on WhatsApp Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/378834799515077). Once the name is approved, you need to register your phone again under the new name.\n    \n\nBefore registering your phone, you need to verify that you own that phone number with a SMS or voice code. For details, see [Verify Phone Ownership](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/guides/migrate-phone-to-different-waba#step-2--verify-phone-ownership).\n\nIn case you would like to remove your phone from the Cloud API, you can deregister a phone. This can be used in cases where you want to move to the On-Premises API or you want to use your phone number in the regular WhatsApp customer app. You can always reregister your phone with Cloud API later by repeating the registration process.\n\n**You set up** [**two-factor verification**](#fc57a30c-97e0-4e06-b74b-89fd7fc5f783) **and** [**register a phone number**](#b22af3db-9d13-4467-a7a6-4026f71984cb) **in the same API call.**\n\n#### Reminders\n\n*   To use these endpoints, you need to authenticate yourself with a system user access token with the **`whatsapp_business_messaging`** permission.\n*   If you need to find your phone number ID, see [Get Phone Number ID](#c72d9c17-554d-4ae1-8f9e-b28a94010b28)."

								"description": "Before sending a message template, you need to create one. See [Create Template Using the WhatsApp Manager](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/creation) for more information. If your account is not verified yet, you can use one of our [pre-approved templates](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/722393685250070).\n\nTo send an interactive message template, make a **POST** call to **`/{{Phone-Number-ID}}/messages`** and attach a message object with `type=template`. Then, add a template object with your chosen button.\n\nInteractive message templates expand the content you can send recipients beyond the standard message template and media messages template types to include interactive buttons using the components object. There are two types of predefined buttons offered:\n\n* Call-to-Action — Allows your customer to call a phone number and visit a website.\n* Quick Reply — Allows your customer to return a simple text message.\n\nThese buttons can be attached to text messages or media messages. Once your interactive message templates have been created and approved, you can use them in notification messages as well as customer service/care messages.\n\n## Message Objects\n\nInteractive message templates can contain the following `Message Objects`:\n\n* [Template Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#template-object)\n* [Component Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#components-object)\n* [Parameter Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#parameter-object)\n* [Currency Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#currency-object)\n* [Date_Time Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#date-time-object)\n\n## Response\n\nA successful response includes an object with an identifier prefixed with **`wamid`**."

These can also be called <code>\"inbound notifications\"</code> throughout the documentation.</p></li><li><p>Message status and pricing notifications: This alert lets you know when the status of a message has changed. For example, the message has been read or delivered. These can also be called <code>\"outbound notifications\"</code> throughout the documentation.</p></li></ul>\n\nAll Webhooks have the following generic JSON format:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"object\": \"whatsapp_business_account\",\n  \"entry\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID\",\n      \"changes\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": {\n              \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\",\n              \"metadata\": {\n                  \"display_phone_number\": \"PHONE_NUMBER\",\n                  \"phone_number_id\": \"PHONE_NUMBER_ID\"\n              },\n              # specific Webhooks payload            \n          },\n          \"field\": \"messages\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\nSee [Components](#cefb0b2a-5fc8-43c3-aea6-865ba98f6061) for information on each field.  \nIf you receive a message that is not supported for the Cloud API beta release, you will get an [unknown message Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks#received-unknown-messages).\n\n### Limitations\n\nAt any time, each Meta App can have only one endpoint configured.

					"description": "**Q: Will all features from the On-Premises API be available on the Cloud API?**\n\nA: We aim to have parity between the on-premises and Cloud APIs starting in 2022. At the beginning of the beta in October 2021, we will have parity with on-premises version 2.33 with the exception of audio, video, List Messages & Stickers. Audio and video messages will become available in November 2021, and List Messages & Stickers will not be available for the beta.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Which company will be providing Cloud API?**\n\nA: The Cloud API will be operated by Meta which provides the [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/), though which developers will access the WhatsApp Business API. WhatsApp will continue to provide the underlying business messaging routing service that it provides for the On-Premise solution.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: How will Meta use the WhatsApp messages that are shared with it by a business?**\n\nA: Meta will not use the messages to inform the ads that a person sees. However, as is always the case, businesses can use chats they receive for their own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Meta or other channels, like email or TV.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Does introduction of a cloud-Cloud API mean WhatsApp is deprecating the existing On-Premise API?**\n\nA: No, we will continue to provide the On-Premise API for now.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Are there any additional costs for the Cloud API?**\n\nA: No, there is no difference in prices between the Cloud API and the On-Premise API. We expect the Cloud API to generate cost savings for developers. The two types of cost savings for the Cloud API are:\n\n1.  Set up cost (including servers or AWS cost)\n2.  Ongoing cost of maintenance (including engineering time for API upgrades).\n    \n\n* * *\n\n**Q: How can a Business Solutions Provider decide whether a given client should use the On-Premise or Cloud API? Do clients get a choice?**\n\nA: A Business Solutions Provider can select which setup a given client should use. We recommend that the majority of clients use the Cloud API for ease of implementation and maintenance.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Will consumers know whether a business is using the Cloud API or the On-Premise API?**\n\nA: Across all our services, WhatsApp makes the end-to-end encryption status of a chat clear. To ensure people know how a business chooses to store and manage their messages with customers, we plan to indicate in our in-app system messages whether businesses have chosen Meta or another company to help store and manage their chats. This will be true for both businesses using the Cloud API, and those working with a BSP using the on-premise API. Conversations in end-to-end encrypted chats will continue to be clearly labeled with a gold system message."

					"name": "Technical Implementation FAQs",
					"item": [],
					"description": "**Q: What is the architecture of the Cloud API?**\n\nA: The Cloud API architecture significantly simplifies the BSP’s operational and infrastructure requirements to integrate with WhatsApp Business API. First, it removes the infrastructure requirements to run Business API docker containers (CAPEX savings). Second, it obviates the need of operational responsibilities to manage the deployment (OPEX savings). For details, refer to the architecture diagram comparing the on-premise and Cloud API deployments.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Will the BSP/direct client need containers and what data will be in those containers?**\n\nA: BSPs and direct clients will not need the WebApp and CoreApp containers that are used in the on-premise product. Meta will manage all database data and media data on behalf of the BSP or direct client.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: What will disaster recovery look like: if a region is unavailable, how much time does it take to move messages to another region?**\n\nA: We will have disaster recovery and data replication across multiple regions. The expected downtime would be within our SLA and usually in the order of less than a minute to less than five minutes.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: How does WhatsApp recommend I conduct load tests for the Cloud API?**\n\nA: As your on-premises performance depends heavily on your hardware, software, and connectivity to WhatsApp servers, if you wish to understand these differences, you can perform your own load tests on Cloud API as you might have done for your own on-premises installation. You can also refer to our performance comparison below to understand more details around how the on-premise and Cloud APIs compare."

					"description": "**Q: Where are the servers for the Cloud API?**\n\nA: Meta has global infrastructure. At this time, the Meta servers operating the API will be located in North America.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Is the Cloud API end-to-end encrypted? What is the encryption model?**\n\nA: For information relating to encryption, see [Cloud API Overview, Encryption](#69be62af-c7c0-4c18-ace9-5b80e655c7ba).\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: What happens to data at rest? How is it handled? How long is it stored?**  \nA: Messages at rest are encrypted. They are automatically deleted after 30 days.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: Does Meta have access to encryption keys?**\n\nA: In order to send and receive messages through Cloud APIs, Cloud API software manages the encryption/decryption keys on behalf of the business. For Cloud API Alpha, WhatsApp will be operating the Cloud API as it is still under development and therefore WhatsApp will have access to message keys for phone numbers using Cloud API. For the Cloud API Beta and GA launches, Meta will operate Cloud API (instead of WhatsApp) and therefore, WhatsApp will not have access to keys nor messages.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: What is the best way to complete vendor/supplier due diligence on the WhatsApp Business API?**\n\nA: If you need to document WhatsApp’s security and compliance positions, we recommend that you refer to our CSA Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire, which we will share via email in early December. It offers an industry-accepted way to document what security controls exist in the Cloud API, providing security control transparency. It provides a set of questions that the Cloud Security Alliance anticipates a cloud consumer or auditor would ask a cloud provider. We document WhatsApp’s answers to the questionnaire, which should provide a basis for your security, control, and process review.\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: What is the security model? Which certifications does the WhatsApp Business API have?**\n\nA: We have obtained SOC 2 Type I certification and are pursuing SOC 2 Type II. You can refer to the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire to understand the security model."

					"description": "**Q: Will the Cloud API be compliant with regional data protection laws such as GDPR, LGPD, PDPB etc.?**\n\nA: We care deeply about protecting your data and we are building the Cloud API with security in mind. We plan to share the specific details about Meta's data practices in the terms that will accompany the Cloud API when it launches in beta next year. \n\n----------\n\n**Q: What does WhatsApp plan to do to make sure the transfer of data from the E.U. to the US is compliant?**\n\nA: On July 16 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decided that the EU-US Privacy Shield is invalid because of concerns about the adequacy of data protection in the US. Our new Business Terms of Service now incorporates Standard Contractual Clauses (replacing the US-EU and US-Swiss Privacy Shield).\n\nWe welcome the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union to confirm the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of data to non-EU countries. Like many businesses, WhatsApp uses Standard Contractual Clauses as a data transfer mechanism from the European Economic Area to the United States in the context of the services we provide to businesses - the WhatsApp Business App and the WhatsApp Business API.\n\nWe will ensure that our businesses and partners can continue to enjoy WhatsApp’s business solutions while keeping their data safe and secure.\n\n<!-- ----------\n\n**Q: Does WhatsApp disclose data to governmental authorities and agencies?**\n\nA: No, we don't give governments or anyone else a \"backdoor\" into our systems. -->"
