		"description": "[WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api), hosted by Meta, is the official WhatsApp Business Platform API used for business messaging. This collection contains common queries, sample responses, and links to supporting documentation that can help you quickly get started with the API.\n\n## **Cloud API Overview**\n\nCloud API allows medium and large businesses to communicate with customers at scale. Using the API, businesses can build systems that connect thousands of customers with agents or bots, enabling both programmatic and manual communication. Additionally, businesses can integrate the API with numerous backend systems, such as CRM and marketing platforms.\n\n[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview)\n\n## Getting Started with Cloud API\n\nTo use the API and this collection you must have a Meta business portfolio, a WhatsApp Business Account, and a business phone number. If you complete the steps in the Cloud API [Get Started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started) guide, these assets will be created for you.\n\n## Get Started as a Solution Partner\n\n[This guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/solution-providers/get-started-for-solution-partners) goes over the steps Solution Partners need to take in order to offer the Cloud API to their customers.\n\n## Migrating from On-Premises API to Cloud API\n\n[This guide explains how to migrate](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/migrating-from-onprem-to-cloud) business phone numbers from On-Premises API to Cloud API.\n\n## Environment\n\nThis collection has a corresponding WhatsApp Cloud API Postman [environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) which you must select when using the collection. Set **current values** for the variables defined in this environment if you wish to use the collection to perform queries.\n\nYou can find most of these values in the [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/) or the **WhatsApp** > **Getting Started** panel in the [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps). However, if you have an access token and your business portfolio ID, you can use queries in the collection to get the remaining values.\n\n## Access tokens\n\nThe API supports both user and system user access tokens. You can get a user access token by loading your app in the [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and navigating to the WhatsApp > Getting Started panel. Alternatively you can use the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) to generate one.\n\nSince user access tokens expire after 24 hours, you'll likely want to generate a system user access token, which lasts up to 60 days (or permanently, if you wish). See [Access Tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/get-started#access-tokens) to learn how to create a system user and system user access token.\n\nOnce you have your token, save it as a **current value** in the environment.\n\n## Business portfolio ID\n\nYou can get your business portfolio ID by signing into the [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com). The ID appears in the URL as the `business_id` query string parameter value. Once you save this as a **current value** in the environment, go to the WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) folder and run the **Get all owned WABAs** query. This will return your WABA ID, which you can save to your environment and then use to determine your business phone number ID.\n\n## Permissions\n\nThe API only relies on two permissions:\n\n- whatsapp_business_management\n    \n- whatsapp_business_messaging\n    \n\nNote that if you get a user access token from the app dashboard, your app will automatically be granted these permissions (by you, on your behalf), so you can use the token to test right away.\n\nQueries that target your business portfolio require the business_management permission, which you may also need based on your business use case. Most developers do not need this permission, however, as accessing your business portfolio is uncommon, and the Meta Business Suite provides nearly all of this functionality anyway.\n\n## Access token debugger\n\nYou can paste any token you generate into the [access token debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/) to see what type of token it is and what permission you have granted to your app.\n\n## Pagination\n\nEndpoints that return lists/collections may [paginate results](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/results) (you'll see previous and next properties in the response). Use the URLs from these properties to get the previous or next set of results. Note that if you click one of these links in Postman, it will open a new query in a new tab which you must save before running (otherwise it can't read your environment variables), so you may wish to cut and paste the URL and run the query in the same tab in which it was returned.",

We enforce [setting two-step verification](#fc57a30c-97e0-4e06-b74b-89fd7fc5f783) during account creation to add an extra layer of security of your accounts.\n*   Name Change: In this case, your phone is already registered and you want to change your display name. To do that, you must first [file for a name change on WhatsApp Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/378834799515077). Once the name is approved, you need to register your phone again under the new name.\n    \n\nBefore registering your phone, you need to verify that you own that phone number with a SMS or voice code. For details, see [Verify Phone Ownership](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/guides/migrate-phone-to-different-waba#step-2--verify-phone-ownership).\n\nIn case you would like to remove your phone from the Cloud API, you can deregister a phone. This can be used in cases where you want to move to the On-Premises API or you want to use your phone number in the regular WhatsApp customer app. You can always reregister your phone with Cloud API later by repeating the registration process.\n\n**You set up** [**two-factor verification**](#fc57a30c-97e0-4e06-b74b-89fd7fc5f783) **and** [**register a phone number**](#b22af3db-9d13-4467-a7a6-4026f71984cb) **in the same API call.**\n\n#### Reminders\n\n*   To use these endpoints, you need to authenticate yourself with a system user access token with the **`whatsapp_business_messaging`** permission.\n*   If you need to find your phone number ID, see [Get Phone Number ID](#c72d9c17-554d-4ae1-8f9e-b28a94010b28)."

								"description": "Before sending a message template, you need to create one. See [Create Template Using the WhatsApp Manager](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/creation) for more information. If your account is not verified yet, you can use one of our [pre-approved templates](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/722393685250070).\n\nTo send an interactive message template, make a **POST** call to **`/{{Phone-Number-ID}}/messages`** and attach a message object with `type=template`. Then, add a template object with your chosen button.\n\nInteractive message templates expand the content you can send recipients beyond the standard message template and media messages template types to include interactive buttons using the components object. There are two types of predefined buttons offered:\n\n* Call-to-Action — Allows your customer to call a phone number and visit a website.\n* Quick Reply — Allows your customer to return a simple text message.\n\nThese buttons can be attached to text messages or media messages. Once your interactive message templates have been created and approved, you can use them in notification messages as well as customer service/care messages.\n\n## Message Objects\n\nInteractive message templates can contain the following `Message Objects`:\n\n* [Template Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#template-object)\n* [Component Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#components-object)\n* [Parameter Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#parameter-object)\n* [Currency Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#currency-object)\n* [Date_Time Object](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/reference/messages#date-time-object)\n\n## Response\n\nA successful response includes an object with an identifier prefixed with **`wamid`**."

			"description": "Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events. Whenever that trigger event occurs, the WhatsApp Business API client captures the event, collects the data, and immediately sends a notification (HTTPs request) to the Webhook URL configured in the Webhooks setup step.\n\nFor the purposes of this use case, your Webhooks server must be reachable from facebook and have HTTPs support and a valid SSL certificate. See [Webhooks, Getting Started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started) for requirements on creating a Webhooks endpoint and configuring the Webhooks product.\n\nTo get Webhooks notifications, your application must subscribe to the WABA you want to receive alerts for. For a full guide, see [Webhooks for WhatsApp Business Accounts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/getting-started/webhooks-for-whatsapp).\n\n  \nThe structure of the webhook payload is explained in the [Webhooks Notification Payload Reference. ](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks/components/) All Webhooks have the following generic JSON format:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"object\": \"whatsapp_business_account\",\n  \"entry\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID\",\n      \"changes\": [\n        {\n          \"value\": {\n              \"messaging_product\": \"whatsapp\",\n              \"metadata\": {\n                  \"display_phone_number\": \"PHONE_NUMBER\",\n                  \"phone_number_id\": \"PHONE_NUMBER_ID\"\n              },\n              # specific Webhooks payload            \n          },\n          \"field\": \"messages\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n ```\n\n  \nIf you receive a message that is not supported for the Cloud API beta release, you will get an [unknown message Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/webhooks#received-unknown-messages).\n\n**This table lists all possible options for the status of a message.**\n\n| Status | Description | WhatsApp Mobile Equivalent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **`sent`** | Message received by WhatsApp server. | One checkmark |\n| **`delivered`** | Message delivered to the recipient. | Two checkmarks |\n| **`read`** | Message read by recipient. | Two blue checkmarks |\n| **`failed`** | Message failed to send. | Red error triangle |\n| **`deleted`** | Message deleted by the user. | Message is replaced in WhatsApp mobile with the note `\"This message was deleted\"`. |",
